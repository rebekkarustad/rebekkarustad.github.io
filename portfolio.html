            The first project at Noroff. I was tasked to make a streaming website where you can purchase high-quality
            videos directly from the people who make them. The website emphasizes that you can quickly discover great
            collections or browse through different categories to find films.

          <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>
          <p>
            This site was made for our first semester project. The assignment was to create a website for the museum.
            Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The
            site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is
            inquisitive and intelligent.

          <h2>The Travel Blog</h2>
          <p>
            For the project exam, we were to create a blog site. The theme was optional, so I chose to make a travel
            blog. The blog was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we were to make a call to a WordPress REST API
            to fetch the data used.

          <h2>Home Decor</h2>
          <p>
            For this assignment, we were to photograph product pictures and make a website around them. I chose to make
            a simple home decor page. The design was the main focus of this website.

          <h2>Shoe Store</h2>
          <p>
            For this Semester Project, the goal was to create an e-commerce website with both customer-facing and an
            admin section. They were both responsive, and the website was to be populated by a Strapi API supplied by
            Noroff. To see it correctly, download both their API and my code.

          <p>
            For the JavaScript Frameworks course assignment we were to make a website with a login functionality with
            WordPress CMS REST API. It had to include a list of objects, a contact page, and a login page, making it
            possible to add content from the frontend.

          <h2>Project Exam 2022</h2>
          <p>
            In our last project exam, the assignment was to create a front end for an existing Social Media company.
            Some essential features had to be included, but design and user experience were not specified. Noroff gave
            us an API that we would work with to build a modern front-end social media application.

          <h2>Semester Project 2023</h2>
          <p>
            For this project we where to use object oriented programming, jQuery and Bootstrap to create a Recetion
            Management dashboard. This dashboard you should be able to manage staff member out-of-office logging,
            delivery tracking, the current date and time. In addition to this, the company brand had to be reflected in
            the system.
